-- | Consumes the current parse input with a parser `p` until the result of a parser `q` is successful.
-- | Does not consume the remaining parse input with the successful result of `q`.

until p = R.until (pure <$> p)

-- | Consumes the current parse input with a parser `p`, with `n` repetitions of `p`.
-- | Does not check if the remaining parse input can be moreover parsed with `p`.
least :: forall m f a b. Monad m => Applicative f => Monoid (f b) => Int -> ParserT a m b -> ParserT a m (f b)
least n p = R.least n (pure <$> p)

-- | Consumes the current parse input with a parser `p`, with `n` repetitions of `p`.

exact n p = R.exact n (pure <$> p)

-- | Consumes the current input with a parser `p` as many times as successful.
-- | Produces a pair of the number of successful repetitions of `p`, and the accumulated result.

-- | Consumes the current input with a parser `p` as many times as successful.
-- | Produces the accumulated result, without the guarantee of being stack-safe for large input.

many p = R.many (pure <$> p)

-- | Consumes the current input with a parser `p` as many times as successful, with at least one occurrence of `p`.
-- | Produces the accumulated result, without the guarantee of being stack-safe for large input.

-- | Consumes the current parse input with a parser `p`, with `m` greedy repetitions of `p`.
-- | Fails if `m` is greater than the constraint `n` passed to the function.
